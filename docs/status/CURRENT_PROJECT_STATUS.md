V6 Discord supervised live-dispatch dry-run gate

## current_product_lane
fail-closed Discord live-dispatch dry-run gate

## accepted_baseline_summary
Discord supervised live-dispatch dry-run gate generated from review-only operator GO packet at starting HEAD `72b816f97f819032a3a93008bd1cacbbd50c29ce`. Packet `discord_dry_run_gate_f9d4f7f1945dc120` has exact payload hash `f9d4f7f1945dc120e02c372436122068a76d3b8d117b5cf88b17c45ffe49838a` and remains blocked/fail-closed.

## status_sha_model
- current remote HEAD verified before this docs/status refresh (`last_verified_remote_sha`): `72b816f97f819032a3a93008bd1cacbbd50c29ce`
- accepted product baseline (`accepted_product_baseline_sha`): `177bf32da72040414c62ef54cbf5e54f059e84e6`
- previous accepted product baseline: `25c80299695efad344db6fdf24316d9a1c1d0537`
- latest status-only repair commit prior to this task: `72b816f97f819032a3a93008bd1cacbbd50c29ce`
- Rule: feature commits may advance repo HEAD beyond the accepted product baseline; status-only repair commits update ledger metadata but do not become product baselines unless explicitly accepted.


## canonical_dashboard_surface
`ui/contentops_v5/` is the canonical current dashboard/app surface unless a newer committed authority document supersedes it.

Canonical entrypoint: `ui/contentops_v5/src/App.tsx`.
Canonical package: `ui/contentops_v5/package.json`.

V6 backend/read-model packets are allowed to exist, but canonical UI integration must target V5.

## legacy_ui_surfaces
- `ui/institutional_operator_cockpit_v4/` — fallback/reference only.
- `ui/institutional_operator_cockpit_v3/` — legacy reference.
- `ui/institutional_operator_cockpit_v2/` — legacy reference.
- `ui/institutional_shell/` — legacy sandbox reference.
- `ui/daily_content_studio/` — legacy sandbox reference.
- `ui/operator_evidence_intake_studio/` — specialized legacy/reference intake studio unless superseded by V5 integration.

## stale_or_deprecated_surfaces
- `ui/operator_approval_queue_evidence_vault/` is absent and is not canonical product UI.
- Standalone generated dashboards must not become canonical through convenience.

## current_v6_loop_status
V6 local deterministic loop components exist for research packets, canonical article drafts, manual distribution evidence registry/readiness summaries, Substack/LinkedIn/X manual publication evidence, operator-supplied feedback intake/backlog summary, and the local V5 feedback/backlog adapter regen/check guardrail. The canonical V5 dashboard remains `ui/contentops_v5/`.

## dispatch/live status
Dispatch/live remains blocked. No autonomous publish, schedule, retry, queue execution, platform API call, provider call, credential read, env value read, browser session read, DM, comment, like, reaction, or live send is authorized by this status ledger.

## provider/env/credential status
Provider/env/credential handling remains gated. Env/key presence may appear only as committed boolean/key-name evidence in approved tasks. No raw env values, credential values, webhook URLs, provider keys, browser session data, token material, cookie/localStorage/sessionStorage data, or secret-derived metadata may be printed or committed.

## active blockers
- Live/provider/platform execution remains disabled unless a future exact approved live task clears all gates.
- Discord supervised live-dispatch dry-run gate remains blocked until operator source artifact, exact GO phrase, destination binding, credential key presence, and active kill switch are present; no live send/webhook validation/outbox/ledger/scheduler/retry is authorized.
- LinkedIn lane is fixture/operator-supplied evidence only; no API, browser automation, URL fetch/scrape, public URL verification, or platform action is authorized.
- Substack manual publication evidence remains fixture/operator-supplied where public URL or metrics evidence is present.
- Future product UI work must remain on `ui/contentops_v5/` unless a newer committed authority doc supersedes this ledger.
- Standalone approval queue UI must not be revived as canonical.

## accepted caveats
- GitHub remote commits and fetched repo files remain runtime authority above this status doc.
- If this status doc conflicts with GitHub remote or newer committed authority docs, the worker must stop and report BLOCKED for reconciliation.
- Do not use chat memory or Project Sources as runtime authority when status doc and repo files disagree.
- Project Sources are context only; GitHub remote and repo-local tests/evidence win.

## next-task safety notes
Read this status ledger and the JSON status file before planning. For UI work, target `ui/contentops_v5/`, not V4/static pages. Do not read env values, credentials, browser session data, provider keys, webhook URLs, cookies, local storage, or session storage. Do not dispatch or publish. Treat next-task text as a soft recommendation only.

- Final status repair commit updates governance metadata only and does not become the product/audit baseline.
- Live/provider/platform execution remains blocked; canonical dashboard remains `ui/contentops_v5/`.
## Operator-Supplied Feedback Intake and Backlog Loop

- Latest task: `TASK_CONTENTOPS_V6_OPERATOR_SUPPLIED_FEEDBACK_INTAKE_AND_BACKLOG_LOOP_V0`.
- Current lane: local/manual-only operator feedback and questions intake feeding deterministic next-article backlog candidates.

- Accepted product/audit baseline is `184062956f4c70509ad1c14b63d7837d9bcb1c58` after feedback/backlog loop push/readback; previous baseline was `3543afe8207bbb8c63eaa90fcbb0f413e57a0bcc`.


## Discord Supervised Live-Dispatch Dry-Run Gate

- Latest task: `TASK_CONTENTOPS_V6_OPERATOR_GO_PACKET_TO_SUPERVISED_DISCORD_LIVE_DISPATCH_DRY_RUN_GATE_HEAVY_BATCH_V0`.
- Current lane: fail-closed Discord dry-run gate consuming review-only operator GO packet evidence.

- Safety: `request_envelope_executable=false`, `dispatch_attempted=false`, `webhook_request_count=0`, `ready_for_dispatch=false`, `live_action_allowed=false`.
- Blocked reasons: missing operator source artifact, GO phrase, destination confirmation, webhook/channel-label/kill-switch key presence.
- No Discord send, webhook validation, executable outbox, approval ledger entry, scheduler, retry, provider call, platform API call, public URL fetch, browser session read, credential value read, or env value read.
